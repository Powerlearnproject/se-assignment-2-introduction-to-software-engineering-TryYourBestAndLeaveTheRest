# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

Answer: Software Engineering is basically the aspect of computer science that focuses on planning, design, development, testing and maintenance of software applications.It simply entails all the life-cycle of software applications

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): 

Answer: The Life cycle of developing a software entails the architeture of producing that software from planning to deploying and maintaining the software and this is what software engineering is all about while programming deals with writing of codes that performs different task.
In General, Software engineering is wider than programming, take for example writing a script that filter an array based on specific algorithm could be understand with knowledge of programming but To build a website that allow user to buy and sell products on that website including tasks like planing of the functions to be added, market size, budgeting... This is only possible with a knowledge of software engineering

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

## Agile Models
1. planning
2. designing
3. development
4. testing
5. deployment
6. maintaining
7. Recure

## Waterfall Models

1. planning
2. designing
3. development
4. deployment

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:

Answer: Waterfall model is a kind of management method that focus on linear planning and following the assigned plan from the start to the end, This simply follow a prescribe description till the end of the project. Robust Planning is a key to achieve a great success in this aspect while Agile Model focuses on flexibility with testing and getting feedback from the first step and then improve on the planning for better production. It is most common in software development and that's why version upgrade is common in most of mobile and desktop application we use today. Also waterfall planning occurs and end within a short period of time and this makes it the best for simple projects but Agile model takes a long time due to recurring of tasks that were not predicted before starting the project

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
